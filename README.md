Class project work for CS300: Analysis and Design
# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The project for this class was broken into two components. The first (project 1) focused on creating pseudocode and runtime analyses for three different data structures completing the same task: vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. The final product required methods that would search, sort, and load data in each data structure. By evaluating the three ADTs for runtime efficiencies, it became clear which was most optimal for the program objective. This data structure, binary search tree, was then used within a C++ program to store course data.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached this problem very conservatively. When it came to doing runtime analyses, I always used the worst case scenario to evaluate 

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
