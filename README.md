Class project work for CS300: Analysis and Design
The project for this class was broken into two components. The first (project 1) focused on creating pseudocode and runtime analyses for three different data structures completing the same task: vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. The final product required methods that would search, sort, and load data in each data structure. By evaluating the three ADTs for runtime efficiencies, it became clear which was most optimal for the program objective. This data structure, binary search tree, was then used within a C++ program to store course data.
I approached this problem very conservatively. When it came to doing runtime analyses, I always used the worst-case scenario to select a structure. Throughout this course, I addressed roadblocks by studying algorithms to truly understand not just what they do but how they work and why they are beneficial. This has helped me design better programs that run faster and handle larger data sets.
